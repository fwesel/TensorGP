## Tensor Network-Constrained Kernel Machines as Gaussian Processes

This repository contains the code to reproduce all experiments in the paper.
It requires the following Python packages:
- PyMC (https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html)
- scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

As mentioned in the PyMC tutorial, PyMC needs to be installed through anaconda, not Pip.
All the necessary UCI datasets are provided as part of the repository.
To reproduce a result in the paper, simply run the associated script.
